I'm Aditya Basu, a pre-final year EE-CS undergraduate at IIT Kharagpur. I'm passionate about programming and open source software and philosophy. I'm in love with Python, although I've been playing around with Go for some time and enjoy it very much.

I'm intrigued by software developement and the idea of building cool tools and systems. For as long as I can remember, computers have excited me and I'm always looking forward to learning technologies and the endless possibilities that come with the wonderful world of computing!
